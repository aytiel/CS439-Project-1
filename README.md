# CS439-Project-1

  In this assignment, we give you a minimally functional thread system. Your job is to extend the functionality of this system to gain a better understanding of synchronization problems.

  You will be working primarily in the "threads" directory for this assignment, with some work in the "devices" directory on the side. Compilation should be done in the "threads" directory.
